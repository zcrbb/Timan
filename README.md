[中文版](./README_zh.md)

**_@Effect:_**

Time management tool for everyone who wants to lazy and escape...

**_@Conceive:_**

1. According to the elements of the things and your physical and mental status, automatically arrange the order of things to be done. **_@Example:_** if you feel _No energy_ and want to play with partenrs. Timan will arrange you some easy to achieve things. If you full of energy, you do not want to piece of things to disturb you to focus on a difficult thing.

2. make a progress bar to describe a thing process.

3. make website View layer dynamically update (Altrough it is vuejs, it has something i don't understand to do this)...

4. Recard thinks which like some short and long term memo. **_@Example:_** buy water and buy present for friends.

5. Through interactive query with user to get user's status: happy (mental status)? tired (patient)? full of energy (mental status)? hungry (physical status)?

**_@Architecture:_**

Frontend: Vuejs + Vuex + Vue router + Vuetify

Backend: Spring boot + Spring Security + JPA?? +Something else I do not decide.

**_@Processing:_**

In 0.0.1 version which has the module of basic TODO apps. Only frontend contained without backend. However it is far from my conceive.
